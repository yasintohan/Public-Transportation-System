# Public Transportation Database System

<img src = "https://github.com/yasintohan/Public-Transportation-System/blob/master/image.jpg">

The public transportation database system stores driving, employee, stop, route and garage information of all kinds of transportation vehicles in the city. Transportation managers can access many personal information of the person using a transportation vehicle using this system. They can also learn the type of vehicle, the number of seats in the vehicle, and the route the vehicle will go.
